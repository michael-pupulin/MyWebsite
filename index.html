        <li> <strong> Courses taken:</strong> Scientific Computing (with C), Functional Analysis, Optimization,
          Partial Differential Equations,  and Agri-Food Innovation. Average 87.2%.</li>
        <li> <strong> Thesis: A spatial model to describe an outbreak of fire blight during bloom.</strong>  I formulated a
          model for fire blight spread during bloom using differential equations. I studied them analytically with calculus and fixed point theorems
          and then ran statistical simulation experiments to draw conclusions about the behaviour of the disease.</li>
        <li > <strong> Canadian Mathematical Society Conference.</strong> I was invited to be a speaker at the 2022 CMS summer conference
        in St. John's, Newfoundland. It was a twenty-minute talk delivered to an audience of experts and colleges. The title of my
        presentation was "Travelling wave solutions in a model of fire blight spread".</li>

        <li > <strong>HQP Scholarship</strong>  The Highly Qualified Personnel Scholarship Program funds graduate students whose research
        aligns with the Ministry of Agriculture's priorities. One condition of the scholarship is that I enroll and complete the Agri-Food and Innovation course.
        In this course, I was paired with an Ontario-based Agri-Food company and tasked with solving a problem they were faced with.
        We would meet weekly with a representative from the company so that we could give updates and receive feedback. My group and I produced
        multiple deliverables, including a summary report and an  informative video. My own personal contribution was an app made through Shiny and R.
        See it <a href="https://michael-pupulin.shinyapps.io/final/">here</a>, as well as the picture below. </li>
