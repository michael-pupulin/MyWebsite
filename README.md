<h2> My first website </h2>
My attempt at making a website with Scala and Scala.js. No JavaScript was written here, only Scala that was then compiled down to equivalent JavaScript through Scala.js.
I like the idea of using one language for everything. Use it here, https://michael-pupulin.github.io/mywebsite/ . Looks like garbage on mobile right now -- I'll have to work on this later.
